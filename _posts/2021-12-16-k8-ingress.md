# Kubernetes Ingress

## What is Ingress?

Ingress is another core system of Kubernetes. It has several functions:

- **Expose a service with a user-friendly URL**: instead of having *192.168.82.1:8080*, the user can see *www.example.com/login* and access directly the pod that offers the service.
- Traffic load balancing (We'll see later why it is not the same a a Cloud provider's load balancing system)
- Process SSL Certificates

- Appoint *virtual* hosting ‚Üí Can easily change the domain name, or have several ones that use the same pods.

## Visualize Ingress

## Install Ingress

- After installing Kubernetes (and Minikube), follow this [link](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/deploy/ "K8 Git Ingress")

- Because we're on a Google Compute Engine we'll be installing Ingress for bare-metal:
  `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/controller-v1.1.0/deploy/static/provider/baremetal/deploy.yaml` ‚Üí `deploy.yaml` file is downloaded

  ![install-ingress-1](/assets/img/Charlie/article_5/install-ingress-1.png)

- We can check the contents of this file: `cat deploy.yaml`

- To execute the `deploy.yaml` file execute the `kubectl create -f deploy.yaml`command. 

  ![create-deploy-yaml](/assets/img/Charlie/article_5/create-deploy-yaml.png)

  - We now have created a namespace, a service and a controller!

- To check their status: `kubectl get pod -n ingress-nginx` ‚Üí ingress-nginx as per the namespace above!

  ![check-pod-status-1](/assets/img/Charlie/article_5/check-pod-status-1.png)

- We'll now check the service status: `kubectl get svc -n ingress-nginx`

  ![check-svc-status-1](/assets/img/Charlie/article_5/check-svc-status-1.png)

  - We can see the port numbers, internal IPs of the service.

Ingress Controller is installed and working!

## In practice

Build 2 services: main page, then pay service.

We want the Ingress rule to **redirect to home page** if address is XXX.COM/ and to the **pay-service** if the link is XXX.COM/pay

- Need to download resources to our VM:
  `git clone https://github.com/237summit/cloud-native`
  ‚Üí we have downloaded the cloud native folder. Inside, the ingress folder contains :
  - yaml files we need to deploy: `marvel-home.yaml`,  `pay.yaml`.
  - and the docker files, html files needed for the webserver.

- We create the files in deployment with following command: `kubectl create -f marvel-home.yaml -f pay.yaml`:

![create-deploy-mvl-pay](/assets/img/Charlie/article_5/create-deploy-mvl-pay.png) 

The services are created properly

- Then we can check the status with the `kubectl get all` command:

![get-all-mvl](/assets/img/Charlie/article_5/get-all-mvl.png)

- Rules set for Ingress controller:

![ingress-rules](/assets/img/Charlie/article_5/ingress-rules.png)We can see how the redirection rules are set here: if the path entered is `/` then redirect to the `marvel-service` service. If the path entered is `/pay` then redirect to the `pay-service` service.



üò• **The rest - was impossible to realise following Îî∞Î≤†Ïø†Ïå§'s class as kubernetes versions have changed.** üò•
There seems to be similar issues with other online classes (Tech With Nana students reported an issue)

# Bonus:

#### Install minikube to create nodes inside 1 single VM/Instance!

Minikube allows to quickly and simply create a local Kubernetes cluster - perfect for testing environments!

- Install rules on this [link](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/)  ‚ö†Ô∏è **requires 2CPUs, 2GB free memory and 20GB free storage**‚ö†Ô∏è

  - For Linux/Ubuntu, x86-64 architecture, copy these lanes in your terminal:

    ```none 
    curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/latest/minikube-linux-amd64
    sudo install minikube-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/minikube
    ```

  - It requires docker, and a root access to it though Minikube can't be installed on root. Here is the trick!
    **You should [give root access to the main user](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/#manage-docker-as-a-non-root-user):**

    - `$ sudo groupadd docker`
    - `$  sudo usermod -aG docker $USER`
    - Log out and should be good.
      

- To start with a 3 node cluster: `minikube start --nodes 3 -p [clustername]`

- The process takes some time, but after it's done, for a cluster name `tabeku` here is how it comes out:![nodelist](/assets/img/Charlie/article_5/nodelist.png)
  - To rename the roles of the nodes, execute: 
    `kubectl label node [nodename] node-role.kubernetes.io/worker=worker`
- Minikube has an addon for using ingress: `minikube addons enable ingress`

#### How is Ingress different from load balance service?

- **Load balancer**: standard way to expose a service to Interner. Only provides one IP, and requires an IP per service. It can be expensive.
- **Ingress**: It is in front of the services and smartly reroutes the user to the right service, through the same IP.
